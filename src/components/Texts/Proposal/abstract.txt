I am proposing a research project to define and comprehend and visualise hyper-humans to assess their environmental, social and economic impact in turn it aims to conscientise humans on everyday products. With the help of machine learning the consumer will be able to check, not only what company the hyper-human owns, but also support them to make a decision about purchasing from him based on how his company responds to environmental, social and economic issues. The algorithm aims to trawl the internet, other databases and indexes to rate the hyper-human performance on the three issues. To do so the hyper-human data will be interpreted visually in the digital realm and as a physical computing installation.
