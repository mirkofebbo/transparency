To encompass this project extract key theoretical concepts from multiple sources. Starting developing the frame, by looking at: 
Forensic Architecture group at Goldsmiths University of London. As they use architectural techniques and technologies to investigate cases of state violence and violations of human rights around the world. Where they developed their own way of visually interpreting complex situations with investigative aesthetics. 
“a weaving together of separate media elements, technologies of vision, imaging, automation and detection, into a series of essay-films that offered deep critical and investigative interrogation of the intersection of politics and technology – is a possible entry point to describe a mode of practice that we want to call Investigative Aesthetics”

Furthermore we can correlate it to Jane Bennett agency of assemblages where all the elements create a living assemblage. With borders and bodies subject to change. She also mentions how thoses borders can affect others by developing a theory of distributive agency and responsibility between the human and nonhuman divide while her work mainly speaks of object a parallel can be made with corporation.

Then encompass those theory within Timothy Morton Hyperobjects. As instances that cannot be comprehend by humans, without help ,as their shear size and temporality define what our brain can comprehend and how these hyper-object trive in consumerism at the cost of the environment. 

Finally, Visualisation : Perception for Design by Colin Ware to build up an understandable visualisation for the hyper-object that is the environment, social and economical impact of one individual. 

Following these semantics I would like to explore the Hyper-human, that can be quickly defined: as a human with so much accumulated wealth that his decisions affect many human lives via its environment, socio-economic impact.
