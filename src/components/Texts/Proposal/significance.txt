We are in a transition state where the status quo is shifting due to the current information revolution with data at its centre. More specifically the public/consumer data. In the case of the western system, the information is gathered to better sell products, promote and target political ideology, train machine learning, and suggest endless media content. Harvesting this power the GAFAM are now making their way at the top of the food chain mainly by gathering and selling information. The goal of this project is to offer a tool for the public to have access to information around CEO’s or hyper-human action and corporate action by offering a visual representation of their interest, and impact on the environment, the workers and the economy. Thus with a tool like this, humans could make use of their consumer buying power to boycott the investment of the individual, as it makes their data public. And as seen with the Elon Musk plain tracking website, they don’t like that so much. It is important for humans to know how to counteract the aggressive economic policy that is neoliberalism and the resulting monopoly taking full advantage of the supply and demand law.
