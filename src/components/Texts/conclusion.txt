The outcome of this research is to have a simple visual that can encompass the immensity of multiple corporations that fall under the umbrella of one human. Furthermore it helps untangle the hyperaesthesia by digging within its aesthetic components. To understand where a company starts and ends within that hyperobject is not a simple task and we barely scratch the surface. As we looked at corporate activity from simple Google searches and they offence from a database, there is still much to uncover, for instance who are they subcontracting and where to find that information? And, from the subcontractor, how are they impacting the world and do they also have subcontractors? It can quickly become a recursive nightmare on its own and perhaps creating that web of corporate connection could be an interesting challenge. Are the employees working unpaid overtime? How much is the difference in wage from the Ceo to the worker? Are they promoting equality of outcome or equality of opportunity? Is there a picture of the Ceo with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell? Does the Ceo have money offshore? How much taxes each company and the Ceo paid each year vs their declared profit? This is a long, extensive task that is not as straightforward and will call this type of individual Hyper-humans, meaning they are part of the 1%.
