After training and testing multiple models for their accuracy against the test set the result revealed that the random forest model would be most reliable in this case. Which is a consistent result over my exploration. Using PCA and T-SNE we can plot the dimensionality of the data sets to see how reliable they are.  But due to the large scope the model had a lot of trouble identifying the category, sometimes cutting down up to 60% of the data due to identifying the text as other and this is why we went with a more direct approach.
