For the last question, it presents an early visual art piece with some indication on how to interpret it and asks the user to rate the design based on its understandability. As this is the first design made that looks at a single corporation it is far from perfect and needs improvement, thus I propose the new design that looks at an individual impact via his corporation and add colour coding for negative and positive instead of their radius.
