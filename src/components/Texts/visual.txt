Regarding the data-visualisation of the Hyper-human, due to the extensive time and a limited number of query per day, the data is made out of random values for now. Altho, the visual does bring up some information. In this particular case we could assume that this hyper-human does not have a lot of data concerning the social aspect of his company, but we can see that more information is available in the environment and economic sections. Besides that we can see that the sections are almost equally spread between good and bad, which is probably due to the nature of randomness to divide somewhat equally.
